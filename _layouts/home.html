                <p>We encourage curious and motivated current and future scientists at all levels to apply. Please contact Dr. Jones at jjones@bio.tamu.edu for more information.</p>
                <p>The Jones Lab believes that a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives contributes to better quality science, and that anyone, no matter their background, can be a scientist. As such, we aim to provide a safe and equitable lab environment that includes and supports researchers of all ethnicities, nationalities, sexual orientations, socioeconomic statuses, genders, ages, and ability levels. Dr. Jones has been actively involved in promoting this perspective as a mentor in the ENDURE (Enhancing Neuroscience Diversity through Undergraduate Research Education Experiences) program for the past several years. Our goal is to continue to seek opportunities to support a diverse and inclusive research and teaching environment at Texas A&M â€“ in our lab, in the department, and throughout the university.</p>
