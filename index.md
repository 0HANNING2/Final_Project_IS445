Our research group aims to understand various aspects (movements, structure designs, underlying mechanisms, etc.) of natural or artificial creatures (humans, animals,  robots, etc.) and realize them in from virtual environment to real world.

Our research interests include:

* Controlling virtual characters to create physically realistic movements
* Understanding human body / movement mechanisms
* Controlling humanoid robots
* Computational design
* Other cutting-edge computer graphics technologies
