I'm a full-stack software developer and musician based in Portland, OR. I'm currently working for SESAC / Harry Fox Agency, leading the front-end team and helping on the back-end whenever I get a chance. I also play guitar and write songs in my free time.

I studied Music Business at Northeastern University in Boston and worked in the Music, Entertainment and Higher Education industries until I found my love for programming. In 2015 I enrolled in the Turing School of Software & Design, which turned out to be the most challenging and rewarding academic experience of my life so far. You can read more about my experience in software and music in the links above.

I'm always looking for interesting music and programming projects to be a part of, so please feel free to reach out.

Thanks,

Matt Rooney
