I've been playing guitar since the fifth grade and have worked in the music industry, one way or another, for most of my career. I've administered artist royalties at EMI (including The Beatles' accounts), toured the country in a van, handled personal and business finances for A-list celebrities, and worked as the Business Manager for MSU Denver's amazing Music Department. Now, I'm lucky enough to be back in the music business helping to write software and applications that improve the way we deliver royalties at SESAC / Harry Fox.

## Tunes
You can hear some of my recordings on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/matthewrooney).

## Projects
I've accompanied a number of singer-songwriters, including [Dave Coffin](http://davecoffin.com/) and [Stacy Rock](http://stacyrock.com/). My last project was a jazz quartet that some good friends and I started in Denver as a way to polish our chops and a reason to put a tie on every now and again. Since moving to Portland in 2016 I haven't been very active but plan to rectify that situation very shortly.
