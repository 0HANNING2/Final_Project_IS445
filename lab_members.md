					<h4>Jeff Jones, PhD</h4>
					
				</header>
				<p>Jeff obtained his Ph.D. in 2015 in the lab of Dr. Douglas McMahon at Vanderbilt University where his research focused on the bidirectional relationship between the molecular and electrical rhythms in the brain's biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). After a brief postdoc with Dr. Luis de Lecea at Stanford University to learn in vivo imaging, Jeff joined the lab of Dr. Erik Herzog at Washington University in St. Louis in 2016, where he studied the inputs to and outputs from the SCN that together generate circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology. In 2021, Jeff started his lab in the Department of Biology at Texas A&M.</p>

					<h4>Logan Perry</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Logan is a rising senior at Texas A&M University currently studying computer science and completing his medical school prerequisites. Logan joined the Jones Lab during Fall 2021, and is hoping to pursue an MD/PhD program in neuroscience because of his experiences in the lab. Away from research, Logan loves experimenting with all sorts of baking and cooking.</p>

					<h4>Ashley Starnes</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Ashley recently graduated Texas A&M University, earning a BS in Psychology Honors. During her undergrad, she worked under Dr. Rachel Smith, where she investigated the effects of noncontingent vs. contingent footshock on cocaine seeking in rats. Aside from research, Ashley enjoys going on walks and singing karaoke with her roommates.</p>
