			<p>
				I am a full-stack developer with a passion for learning and finding creative solutions. My experience in the music industry and business management has taught me how to communicate, improvise and succeed with many different personalities. I like being part of a team that is creative, flexible and committed to the quality of their product. In March of 2016 I graduated form the <a href='https://www.turing.io/'>Turing School of Software & Design</a> with a certificate in Web Application Development. The program emphasized Ruby, Rails and JavaScript and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an intense and rewarding way to learn how to program.

					<h3>Ruby</h3>
					<p>
						Ruby is the first programming language I ever learned. Ruby's syntactic sugar and simplicity make it a great first programming language. It's community, documentation and flexibility make it fun to use professionally. Reviewing and learning from the other Rubyists at SESAC / HFA has taught me that, while Ruby is often considered "slow", good code and architecture can overcome many of it's faults and it will always be fun to write.

					<h3>JavaScript</h3>
					<p>
						JavaScript is great. Of course it is "the language of the web", but there's so much more to love about it - vanilla JS, ES6, Node, NPM, Electron and so many interesting and different front-end frameworks. Our front-end at <a href="https://hub.harryfox.com">Hub.Harryfox.Com</a> is built with Angular 1.x and CoffeeScript and I can't wait to migrate to a newer framework using ES6.
