Over the past 10 years I have been involved with Technology in some for or another from break-fix to deployment.  This portfolio is a place where I can record projects and display my achievements.

This portfolio will contain any homelab projects I have completed, relevant info on how to configure hardware, applications and services, updates on new homelab tech deployed and maybe the occasional blog post on current projects Iâ€™m undertaking.

*Disclaimer: This is my personal blog. Any views or opinions represented in this blog are personal and belong solely to me and do not represent those of people, institutions or organizations that I may or may not be associated with in professional or personal capacity, unless explicitly stated.*
