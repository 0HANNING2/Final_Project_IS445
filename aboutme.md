<p>I'm a software developer for Cognizant Technologies in Pune, IN.

	Graduated from LPU, Punjab in <b>Computer Science Engineering</b> with a minor in <b>Internet of Things</b> and its applications. <br />
	Loves to read fiction, watch thrillers, skim through <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Coding horror</a>, play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beautiful_Game">the beautiful game</a> - a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF">Los Blancos</a>. <br/><br/>
