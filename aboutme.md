### Aspiring Data Scientist actively trying to make a positive impact on others health & wellness and the environment.
![ProfilePic](/assets/images/aboutme.jpg){: .center-block :}

 My name is Charles Vanchieri and for the past 12 years I have been working privately as a Health Consultant for some really great families and individuals in the Bay Area, CA.  Though I did receive a BA in Environment Studies in 2007, the health & wellness field was always a natural fit for me, and so with a few great opportunities that is where I began my professional career.  I have always had a big interest in technology and a desire to get involved with coding but I had never come across an opportunity that I could make work financially or with a pretty hectic schedule.
 
 This was until a few months ago. That is when I discovered Lambda Schoolâ€™s Part Time Data Science Program.  I have been waiting. . . hoping. . . for an opportunity, and here it is.  So here I am, excited, nervous, but eager and ready to take full advantage of the opportunity in front of me.
