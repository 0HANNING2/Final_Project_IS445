I don’t want to just be a coder, but someone who can be relied on in a team to contribute meaningful solutions to daunting problems. I’m a methodical maniac by nature, and I believe one must constantly keep learning in order to be able to solve complications effectively. Recently, my curiosity has been piqued by the fields of Data Science and Information Security. The last year I've spent in the InfoSec Club at the university has been monumental in my search for knowledge within the fields I am interested in, and I hope I can continue to grow and satiate my desire to learn.
