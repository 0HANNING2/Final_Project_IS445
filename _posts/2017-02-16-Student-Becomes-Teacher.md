<p>I'm going to be the teacher of mine own class. Make a gradebook for all of mine students.When teaching a class, it's important to take the students' averages in order to assign grades.</p>
        <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When you divide an integer by another integer, the result is always an integer (rounded down, if needed).</li>
    <li>When you divide a float by an integer, the result is always a float.</li>
<!--end-of-excerpt-->    
    <li>To divide two integers and end up with a float, you must first use <code>float()</code> to convert one of the integers to a float.</li>
    <li>The <code>\</code> character is a continuation character. The following line is considered a continuation of the current line.</li>
    
</ul>
