<h3>
When planning a vacation, it's very important to know exactly how much you're going to spend.
You're going to need to take a plane ride to get to your location.
You're also going to need a rental car in order for you to get around.
Great! Now that you've got your 3 main costs figured out, I'm put them together in order to find the total cost of your trip.
You can't expect to only spend money on the plane ride, hotel, and rental car when going on a vacation. There also needs to be room for additional costs like fancy food or souvenirs.
Now that you have it all together, let's take a trip.

What if we went to Los Angeles for 5 days and brought an extra 600 dollars of spending money?
