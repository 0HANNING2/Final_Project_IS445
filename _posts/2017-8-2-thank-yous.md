<p>Today I’d like to share with you a few school-related thoughts and ideas that have come about in the past few months as I finished my degree. Since I have a lot of people to thank and I lot of introspection to express, this is a bit more long and ramble-y than I expect future posts to be. Bear with me here. </p>

			<h2>This is all?</h2>
		</header>

<p>The first and probably the most interesting thought is “this is all I need to know for a Bachelors?” For the entirety of my life, a Bachelors degree seemed like this big accomplishment, this threshold that you cross to start becoming an adult (I know that view isn't very inclusive of people who don't get bachelors, which I'll touch on later). However, when the moment came, it felt like nothing special. One moment I was stressing about plasma physics (turns out, I'm not very good at it) and learning climate feedback processes, and the next it was over, and I had a degree. While this feeling always hits me at the end of school years, it was particularly jarring now that I actually graduated.</p>

<p> I expect that this is a feeling that many students experience as they finish their degrees. I have many friends that don't plan to pursue a higher technical degree (not considering those who want MBAs), and it still seems somewhat odd to me that they're done with formal schooling. While all of them still have various trainings and certifications to go through, maybe even a Reactor Operator license test, they never have finals or general education courses to take again.</p>

<p> I guess its a nice coincidence that I chose to pursue higher education, because I just don't feel like I know enough to go out into the world and become a "real adult." There’s certainly a sense of pride that comes with completely a degree, but also a sense of worry. There’s so much to learn and so much more that I could’ve accomplished in these last 4 years. </p>

<p>So, the only thing I can say to myself and to all of my peers feeling the same way, is <i><b>yes, you've earned it</b></i>. It's easy to forget, but an undergraduate degree is typically about 128 credits, or the equivalent of over 42 three-credit-hour courses. Even if some of them were easy, taken in high school, or taken over the summer at a community college, that's still an incredible amount of information to receive and prove (to some degree), that you understand.</p>

<p> We certainly don't know everything we need for a successful career, but that's not what a Bachelors degree is about. A bachelor's degree in engineering is about gaining the fundamental understanding of physics and math principles, along with critical thinking skills. Much of our coursework will not directly relate to our future jobs, and that's ok. All of those hours spend deriving and computing weren't meant to make us experts on neutron diffusion, electronic circuits, or radiation protection, but rather to introduce a bunch of concepts and methods, some of which might be useful in the future (depending on your job).</p>

<p>Anyway, I think we all know this but I certainly needed several reminders over the last four years so I figure I'd throw it out there.</p>

			<h2>Wait, What Next?</h2>
		</header>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, I'm headed to the University of Wisconsin in the fall to continue pursuing Nuclear Engineering for an MS/PhD. As much as that seems like a well-defined plan, that's about as far as I've gotten (plus joining a research group). And while I've gotten plenty of comments reminding me that that's a perfectly acceptable place to be right now, it still represents a pretty new phase of my life.</p>

You see, at 8 years old I was telling people I wanted to major in meteorology, specifically weather risk consulting. At 17, when I made the switch to nuclear engineering, I was immediately telling people I was going to go be a reactor engineer. The point is, I have <i>always</i> had a plan, and now I don't. I can't tell you what my dissertation will be on, and therefore I can't tell you where I want to end up after completing it.

I expect many of my fellow students feel the same. Gone are the days where a large chunk of people spent their whole lives working for one company. Gone are the days where nuclear power plants were being build all around the US, with the guarantee of jobs for 40, 60 (maybe even 80 years for a couple plants).

			<h2>Gratitude</h2>
		</header>

<p> Now I come to the point that is most vital to this whole post—acknowledging those that have made a difference in my undergraduate career. I don’t want to write a long list and name a bunch of names, but I do want to make several points about the importance of my friends, family, mentors, and professors in helping me get to where I am today. </p>

<p> First is the age-old comment that "you can't become an engineer alone." While I made it through a surprising number of classes without collaborating with students or going to office hours (file that under: don't do again), I would have never made it through most of my core technical classes without the endless support of my fellow students and patient help of teaching assistants.

<p>I'd like to quickly thank all the professors and nuclear professionals that have helped me along the way. I'm lucky enough to have had an astounding number of incredible professors at the University of Illinois, and many of these professors have also shaped my research interests through their guidance and teaching. I've also had the opportunity to work with amazing individuals at Exelon Generation and the Idaho National Laboratory during internships. Each summer I learned real-world applications of my degree and developed an even stronger passion for nuclear power.</p>

<p>Beyond the people that have helped shape my life, I'd like to acknowledge the enormous impact of various organizations that affected my life in positive ways. First of all is the American Nuclear Society (both the <a href="https://ans.npre.illinois.edu">University of Illinois student section</a> and <a href="https://ans.org">nationally</a>). The society itself has allowed me to develop a strong network of students, professors, and professionals around the US and the ANS conferences I've attended have given me enormous insight into the part of nuclear science and engineering that interest me the most. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunities ANS has given me so far, and I look forward to continued leadership and service positions, starting with the ANS Student Director, a position on the Board of Directors I will fill between June 2017 and June 2019. </p>

<p> Also important is the impact of financial assistance on my life. The reason I point this out is to remind people that your donations (or in some cases, tax dollars) really do make a difference to students, especially if they are related to a conference or event attendance. Almost every single conference I've attended (ANS Annual/Winter/Student, UWC, WMS) has been at least partially pay for by a scholarship, internship, or my university. Scholarships from organizations like the American Nuclear Society, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the DOE's Nuclear Energy University Programs have helped me focus on my education instead of worrying about finances.</p>

<p> Finally, I have to thank my family. My family has been extremely supportive of my interests and hobbies since I was born and their support has been essential to every milestone I've achieved.</p>

			<header class="major">
				<h3>Privilege</h3>
			</header>

<p> I addition to all the wonderful people and organizations that have helped me along the way, I also want to acknowledge the various privileges that have made my path easier than many of the people around me.</p>

<p>The most visible is the access to education that I have been granted. I was raised in an area where I had the chance to go to good schools, I lived in communities with "Gifted and Talented" (now named something different) math classes, and even the opportunity to take classes over the summer in areas that interested me. I came in to college with over 30 credits from AP courses, and I didn't even come close to taking every AP class that was offered. Together, all of these small things made my journey to an engineering degree easier than many of my colleagues. For an interesting discussion on privilege and opportunity, feel free to check out the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930">Outliers</a> by Malcolm Gladwell. I found this book to have  alot of relevance to my life.</p>

<p>Next in the list of subtle things that helped me along my path is the educational background of my family. On both sides of the family, almost everyone I'm related to has a Bachelors, at the very minimum. Many have higher degrees and doctorates, including MD, JD, PhD, PharmD. Several of them are engineers. So to me, a bachelors was always an expectation, and the bare minimum at that. In fact, upon hearing my decision to pursue a PhD rather than just a masters, one family member simply smiled at me and said "we hoped you would."</p>

<p>I compare this to a few of my friends who are one of if not the only person in their family with a college degree. For some of these students, college may not have always been the expectation, and receiving a Bachelors carries a greater significance. </p>

<p>Again, acknowledging the opportunities that I have had is not discounting the hard work that I have put into my degree, rather just noting that not everyone's path has been as straightforward as mine.</p>

<br>

<p>I know this was more like a big thank you letter than a blog post, and I promise future posts will be more interesting!</p>
