<p>For those of you who donâ€™t know me, my name is Katie Mummah and I am a recent graduate of the University of Illinois and an incoming graduate student at the University of Wisconsin in Nuclear Engineering. I got my Bachelors of Science a few weeks ago, so I decided to start a blog. </p>

<p>For those of you who know me well (or have had me in your class), you probably know that writing has never been my strong suit. However, practice makes perfect and I have a lot of things to say, so welcome. </p>

<p>My first post is going to be about my love of mountains and how that's related to some of the guiding mantras of my life.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, on my first weekend in New Mexico, I decided to hike the highest mountain in the state. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler_Peak_(New_Mexico)'><Mount Wheeler></a> is a a 13,159 foot peak located near Taos Ski Valley in Northern New Mexico.</p>

	<h3>Background on Wheeler Peak</h3>
</header>

<p>There are two ways to summit Wheeler, the Williams Lake route and the Bull-of-the-Woods Route. Williams lake is a 4 mile one-way route with 3,200 foot elevation gain/loss (~2,000 of which is in less than 2 miles), and Bull-of-the-Woods is 8 mile one-way route up over 4,000 feet but with a more steady grade. Bull-of-the-Woods starts at a lower elevation and approaches Wheeler from a different angle than Williams Lake.</p>

<p>My original goal was to hike up the first to miles to Williams Lake, where I would camp out. The next morning I would summit from the Williams Lake route. Unfortunately, I got to the top of the mountain and realized I didn't pack all of the necessary gear to stay warm. In addition to that, there were some ominous clouds rolling up around 3 pm, so I descended and decided to do the entire ascent the next day.</p>

<p>I met a few locals, who recommended taking Bull-of-the-Woods up the mountain. This is partially due to the scenic nature of that route, but importantly due to the heavy snow on the steep part (last ~2 miles) of the Williams Lake trail.</p>

<p><i>Note: it also turns out that Bull-of-the-Woods was actually closed due to the forest service fixing some scree trails. However, I saw nothing online about it, and there was no signage on the trail identifying this. I learned this at the summit from someone who had called the forest service and was informed that it was closed. <br> I did not see anyone working during my hike and I would not have attempted Bull-of-the-Woods had I known it was closed.</i></p>

	<h3>Why is this Worth Talking About?</h3>
</header>

<p>This climb held some personal significance to me for a few reasons. First of all, it was a reaffirmation that I can go out and explore the world on my own. I've never climbed a mountain alone before, and it really forced me to think critically about my preparation and my decisions--a small misstep could land me lost in the woods with only my own gear and knowledge to guide me back.</p>

<p>Next, I had a bit of a score to settle with state High Points. Last summer, the first mountain I hiked was Mt. Borah, the tallest mountain in Idaho. Although shorter than Wheeler, it is certainly more difficult. I hiked it with a heavy pack (for me) and was in worse shape than I usually care to admit. Although I came close to the summit, I ultimately pushed myself too far and became "gripped," as climbers call it, or more simply, I had a panic attack.</p>

<p>While panic attacks are actually quite common and nothing to be ashamed of, I had never had one and didn't even realize what was happening. I won't go into too much gory detail, but I was more terrified than I had ever been before, crying uncontrollably, and worst of all, barely able to breathe. I refused to move another foot upwards and therefore missed the actual summit.

While there wasn't much I could've done to stop the panic attack (besides having climbed more mountains), this stuck in my head as a something to improve on in the future.

So now, starting the hiking season (not too many mountains to climb in Illinois), I made a point of hiking the tallest mountain in the state to prove to myself that I could actually get to the summit. While this doesn't seem like a big deal, it meant a lot to me. Climbing this mountain
